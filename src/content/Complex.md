# Usage

First we need to read this file and put the contents of the example files in the place of the linked files. Then we will use the resulting data as markdown to render.

## Simple Component

Here is an example file that has a simple component. We will have to pass in the `Header` component to the `scope` of the `LiveProvider`

```jsx
{ "react": "./examples/simple-example.tsx" }
```

## Class Example / Component

This will fail for a few reasons. We are working out how to work with this type of example file.

```jsx
{ "react": "./examples/class-example.tsx" }
```
